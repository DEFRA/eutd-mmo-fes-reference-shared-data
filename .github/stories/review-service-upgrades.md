## Per-repo repeatable steps

### 0) Prep

1. **Capture work identifiers before branching**
   - Ask these questions and confirm the answers:
     - Ticket number (for example: `ABC-123`)
     - Sprint number (for example: `182`)
     - Short work summary slug (for example: `review-service-to-identify-if-upgrades-are-required`)

2. **Checkout a fresh branch**
   - Use the collected values in the branch name:
     - `git checkout -b feature/<ticket>-sprint-<sprint>-<summary-slug>`
   - Example:
     - `git checkout -b feature/ABC-123-sprint-182-review-service-to-identify-if-upgrades-are-required`

3. **Clean slate**
   - Ensure you're not carrying local build artefacts, and you're on the right Node version (use `.nvmrc` / `.node-version` if present).

4. **Ensure `.nvmrc` exists and is correct**
   - If `.nvmrc` exists, verify it matches the repo's expected Node version.
   - If `.nvmrc` does not exist, create it with the repo's Node version.
   - Preferred source order for version:
     - `package.json` -> `engines.node`
     - Existing `.node-version`
     - Team standard/default (document what was used)
   - Example:
     - `echo "20" > .nvmrc`
   - Then run:
     - `nvm use`

---

### 1) Establish a baseline

1. **Install exactly what the lockfile specifies**
   - `npm ci` (preferred for reproducibility)
   - If the repo doesn't have a lockfile, use `npm install` and consider adding one.

2. **Run tests/build once (baseline sanity)**
   - `npm test` / `npm run test`
   - `npm run build` (if applicable)
   - Optional but helpful: `npm run lint`

3. **Create a rollback checkpoint**
   - `git add package.json package-lock.json .nvmrc 2>/dev/null || true`
   - `git commit -m "chore: baseline before dependency upgrades"`
   - If you do not want a commit, keep working tree clean and use:
     - `git checkout -- package.json package-lock.json`

---

### 2) Vulnerability check (what changed?)

1. **Run the audit**
   - `npm audit`

2. **Capture the output**
   - Note:
     - Package(s) affected
     - Severity
     - Whether it's **direct** or **transitive**
     - Recommended fix version (if available)

Tip: If the repo is noisy with transitive issues, focus first on _direct deps_ you control --- upgrades there often lift the transitive chain.

---

### 3) Apply fixes safely

Work from least risky to most risky:

#### A) Safe automated patch/minor where possible

1. **Attempt the non-breaking audit fix**
   - `npm audit fix`

2. **Re-run**
   - `npm audit`

> Avoid `npm audit fix --force` as a default --- it can introduce breaking majors.

#### B) Targeted upgrades for direct dependencies (minor upgrades)

1. **See what's outdated**
   - `npm outdated`

2. **Update minor versions (conservatively)**
   - Use one of these approaches:
     - **Manual targeted updates** (recommended for control):
       - `npm install <pkg>@^<latest_minor>` for each direct dep you approve
     - **Broad minor update** (quicker but less controlled):
       - `npm update`
         This updates packages within the semver ranges in `package.json`.

3. **Re-run**
   - `npm audit`

4. **Agent mode: upgrade one dependency at a time with validation**
   - For each direct dependency you plan to upgrade (minor/patch only, no major):
     1. `npm install <pkg>@<target_non_breaking_version>`
     2. `npm test`
     3. `npm run build`
     4. If either command fails:
        - Revert that package change immediately:
          - `git checkout -- package.json package-lock.json`
        - Record package name + error summary in your report.
        - Continue with next package.
     5. If both pass, keep the change and continue.
   - This gives an auditable pass/fail result per package and avoids bundling breakages.

#### C) If vuln is transitive-only

Options in order:

1. **Upgrade the nearest direct dependency** that brings in the vulnerable transitive.

2. If still stuck:
   - Consider **overrides** (npm supports `"overrides"` in `package.json`) to force a safe transitive version.

3. Document why you used overrides (they're powerful, but you want future-you to remember).

---

### 4) Validate the repo still works

1. `npm test`
2. `npm run build` (if relevant)
3. Smoke check the app (if it's a UI)
4. Optional: run the repo's e2e or contract tests (if any)

5. **Final regression after all accepted upgrades**
   - `npm test`
   - `npm run build`

---

### 5) Produce a clean PR

1. **Commit only what's needed**
   - `package.json`
   - `package-lock.json`

2. **Commit message rule (ticket number mandatory)**
   - Include the ticket number in **every** commit message.
   - Recommended format:
     - `<type>(<scope>): <change summary> <TICKET-NUMBER>`
   - Example:
     - `chore(deps): upgrade direct dependencies and patch transitive tar vulnerability ABC-123`
   - Commit command example:
     - `git commit -m "chore(deps): upgrade direct dependencies and patch transitive tar vulnerability ABC-123"`

3. **Suggested commit sequence**
   - Baseline/setup commit (optional):
     - `git commit -m "chore(setup): align node version and baseline checks ABC-123"`
   - Dependency upgrade commit:
     - `git commit -m "chore(deps): apply non-breaking dependency upgrades ABC-123"`
   - Overrides commit (only if used):
     - `git commit -m "chore(deps): add npm overrides for transitive vulnerability mitigation ABC-123"`

4. **PR description template**
   - What you ran: `npm ci`, `npm audit`, `npm audit fix`, `npm outdated`, update approach
   - What changed (high level)
   - Before/after audit summary (number of vulns by severity)
   - Any overrides and why
   - Test evidence (commands + results)
   - Rollback log (packages reverted due to test/build failures)
   - `.nvmrc` status (created/updated + value)

---

## Agent-friendly execution sequence (copy/paste)

1. Ask for ticket number + sprint number + summary slug
2. `git checkout -b feature/<ticket>-sprint-<sprint>-<summary-slug>`
3. Ensure `.nvmrc` exists/updated, then `nvm use`
4. `npm ci`
5. Baseline: `npm test && npm run build`
6. `npm audit`
7. `npm audit fix`
8. `npm audit`
9. `npm outdated`
10. Upgrade direct deps one-by-one (minor/patch only)
11. After each package: `npm test && npm run build`
12. On failure: revert `package.json` + `package-lock.json`, log failure, continue
13. Final: `npm test && npm run build && npm audit`
14. Commit using ticket in message, then prepare PR with before/after audit + revert log + `.nvmrc` note

## About `npm audit --json | npm-audit-markdown --output report.md`

- Useful for reporting, not for fixing.
- It helps you generate readable evidence of current vulnerabilities.
- It does **not** decide non-breaking upgrade paths by itself.
- Keep it as an extra reporting step after `npm audit`, for example:
  - `npm audit --json | npm-audit-markdown --output report.md`
  - Attach `report.md` to the PR for traceability.

---

## Recommended "standard operating procedure" you can copy/paste into each repo's PR

- Baseline: `.nvmrc` verified/created, `npm ci`, tests/build pass ✅
- Audit: `npm audit` (recorded output)
- Fixes:
  - `npm audit fix` (no force)
  - Minor updates (targeted, one-by-one)
  - After each package: `npm test` + `npm run build`
  - Revert package change immediately if validation fails
  - Optional: `overrides` for stubborn transitive issues
- Verification: tests/build/lint ✅
- Final: `npm audit` clean or risk documented ✅
